    The following repository
    `birkenfeld/sphinx-contrib/ <https://github.com/sphinx-contrib/legacy>`_
    contains many useful extensions
    to improve the rendering of
    `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_ documentation:

    * `imagesvg <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sphinxcontrib-imagesvg/>`_: to include svg figures

    .. demo::

       <button>Click me!</button>

    The following extension replaces the search bar by an entry which
    mimicks autocompletion by showing results as the user is typing:

    * `lunrsearch <https://github.com/rmcgibbo/sphinxcontrib-lunrsearch>`_

    Their are now part of the default configuration
    proposed by this module. See
    :func:`set_sphinx_variables <pyquickhelper.helpgen.default_conf.set_sphinx_variables>`.
